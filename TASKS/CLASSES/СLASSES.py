OOP Exercise 1: Create a Class with instance attributes.
Write a Python program to create a Vehicle class with max_speed, mileage, name and capacity instance attributes.

OOP Exercise 2: Create a child class Bus that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class

OOP Exercise 3: Class Inheritance, create func seating_capacity with arg: capacity. Func return string:
The seating capacity of a {self.name} is {capacity} passengers. Create duplicate func in Bus classes and give default

OOP Exercise 4: Define a property that must have the same value for every class instance (object).
Define a class attribute ”color” with a default value white. I.e., Every Vehicle should be white.
Create class Car.
Expected Output: 
Color: White, Vehicle name: School Volvo, Speed: 180, Mileage: 12
Color: White, Vehicle name: Audi Q5, Speed: 240, Mileage: 18

"""
OOP Exercise 5:
Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating
capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge.
So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.

Note: The bus seating capacity is 50. so the final fare amount should be 5500. 
You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class.
