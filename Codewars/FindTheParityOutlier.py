"""
You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large)
 containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised
 of even integers except for a single integer N.
 Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

    evens = [i for i in integers if i % 2 == 0]
    return odds[0] if len(odds) == 1 else evens[0]

print(find_outlier([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 3]))
